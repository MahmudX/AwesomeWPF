I'm trying to use [Windows UI library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/) in my WPF app, and whenever I install `Microsoft.UI.Xaml` I get the following error.

> Microsoft.UI.Xaml nuget package requires TargetPlatformMinVersion >= 10.0.15063.0 (current project is -1)

How to resolve this issue?

My windows SDK version is the latest version downloaded from [here](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-US/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/).

My OS version is **20H2** and the build number is **19042.685**

I tried changing the targeted framework from .NET Core 3, 3.1, and .NET 5.
